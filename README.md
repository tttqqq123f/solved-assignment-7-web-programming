The function will be scripted to search the second prompt for the first prompt. In other words, the program will search the second string entered to see whether it contains the first string entered. If the string is found, alert the user with the index position at which the string was found. If the string is not found, provide the user with an appropriate message.<strong>Script 2</strong>Next, create another HTML page that contains four buttons. Each button when clicked should cause an alert dialog to display a different time or date in relation to the current time. The first button is a <strong>Now</strong> button that alerts the current date and time. The second button is a <strong>Yesterday</strong> button that alerts the time and date 24 hours ago. The third button is a <strong>10 Years Ago</strong> button that alerts the time and date 10 years ago. The fourth button is a <strong>One Week from today</strong> button that alerts the time and day one week from today.<strong>Script 3</strong>Now, create an HTML page that tests at least 5 Math functions.
